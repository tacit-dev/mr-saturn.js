# Boing!

This is a quick thing I made inspired by [oneko.js](https://github.com/adryd325/oneko.js)!

Look at Mr. Saturn from the [MOTHER series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game_series)) wander aimlessly or click anywhere on the website and Mr. Saturn will go to that point.

See it in action on [my website](https://tacit.neocities.org/saturn)!


## What can Mr. Saturn do?

- Walk

(No intention to add more features)


## Usage

Just include the script in your html like this just like you would do with oneko.

```html
<body>
	<script src="mr-saturn.js"></script>
</body>
```

You can also set some attributes to set an initial position (in pixels or `"center"`) and the frame rate.

```html
<body>
	<script src="mr-saturn.js" x="500" y="center" fps="60"></script>
</body>
```

You can check the [index.html](index.html) for a minimal html example!
